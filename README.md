**12-Week Program | Nov 10, 2025 - Feb 2, 2026**

*Building real Bitcoin & Lightning applications for Africa*

</div>

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Ship real Bitcoin/Lightning applications that solve real-world problems** — with a bias for African use-cases — or deliver meaningful open-source contributions with verifiable proof-of-work (PoW).

This is where learning meets execution. Where ideas become code, and code becomes impact.

---

## 🚀 Core Objectives

### 1. **Build Real Solutions**
Create working prototypes of Bitcoin/Lightning products that address clearly defined problems in African contexts.

### 2. **Ship with Rigor**
Apply product thinking and crypto-native rigor: prioritize security, privacy, and reliability over vanity features.

### 3. **Build in Public**
Maintain transparent development with public repos, weekly demos, documented decisions, and open metrics.

### 4. **Iterate with Users**
Work in small, cross-functional teams with ruthless scoping and user feedback every sprint.

### 5. **Prove Your Work**
Deliver verifiable proof-of-work through merged PRs, working demos, pilot reports, and production-ready code.

## 🛤️ Tracks

### 🔨 **Build Track — Ship an App**

Deliver a working MVP of a Bitcoin/Lightning product addressing a real problem.

#### **💰 Chama Lightning Vault**
Group savings with spending limits, time-locks, and multi-sig releases

#### **🎓 School Fees Escrow on Lightning**
Milestone-based disbursement for tuition with parent protections

#### **🏪 Offline-first Market PoS**
Low-bandwidth Lightning PoS for open-air markets (QR + SMS fallback)
